        "> This notebook presents a complete workflow for tri-class sentiment classification on the FiReCS dataset of Taglish product reviews. The pipeline begins with data loading, cleaning, and a reproducible 80/20 stratified split that preserves class balance and writes split IDs to disk for consistent evaluation across runs. A simple baseline is then established using TF-IDF features with Logistic Regression to provide an interpretable reference score. The workflow proceeds to transformer fine-tuning with two backbones: a multilingual encoder (XLM-RoBERTa) and a Filipino-prior encoder (RoBERTa-Tagalog). Both models are adapted to three sentiment labels and trained using a shared evaluation function that reports macro-F1 and accuracy on the fixed validation split.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Each section of the notebook follows a consistent structure to aid replication. The preprocessing cell prepares tokenization with a fixed sequence length and converts the data into tensor-ready datasets. The training cell configures arguments, constructs the trainer, performs fine-tuning, evaluates on the validation set, and saves the best checkpoint together with its tokenizer. A brief inference cell verifies behavior on short sample texts, while an analysis cell produces a confusion matrix and a per-class report to explain common errors between negative, neutral, and positive. A final export cell aggregates all runs into a single log, writes spreadsheet summaries for grading and reporting, and highlights the strongest configuration per model.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The notebook supports both thorough runs and quick sweeps. A fast mode reduces training time by using a smaller training slice and an optional early-stopping callback, which is useful for exploring learning rate, batch size, and epoch count under limited time or hardware. Final headline scores are obtained from full runs that reuse the same split and metric function. Saved checkpoints, split ID files, and exported logs ensure that results can be reproduced and compared fairly across members and model choices.\n",

A stratified split holds label balance constant, which is printed to confirm the split is fair.

        "**`Purpose`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Run Optuna-driven grid and random searches on the reduced training slice, capture validation/test metrics for the best trial in each strategy, and generate artifacts needed for the Excel log and IEEE report. The search is scoped to stay within ~30 minutes on classroom hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Input`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses the tokenized datasets (`ds_train`, `ds_val`, `ds_test`), global tokenizer/model selections, and shared helpers (`compute_metrics`, `make_training_args`). Configuration depends on `AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED`, `GRID_SEARCH_SPACE`, `RANDOM_SEARCH_SPACE`, trial limits, and options such as `FAST_MODE`, `AUTO_TUNE_USE_CLASS_WEIGHTS`, and `MAX_AUTOTUNE_EPOCHS`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Output`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Writes per-strategy trial tables (`tuning/grid_trials.*`, `tuning/random_trials.*`), a combined `tuning/all_trials.*`, and a `tuning/strategy_summary.*` comparison sheet. Each winning configuration is retrained, evaluated on validation and test splits, logged to `runs_log.csv`, and its predictions exported for downstream analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Details`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines a lightweight `WeightedTrainer` compatible with Optuna’s newer training hooks, computes class weights from the current training labels, and registers helper functions to build Trainers for suggested hyperparameters. Optuna’s `GridSampler` and `RandomSampler` explore the respective spaces, timing each trial and storing validation metrics so the study can be resumed or audited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Line-by-line Description`**\n",
        "\n",
        "- `import gc` and `import time` bring in garbage-collection and timing utilities so each trial can free memory explicitly and record wall-clock duration for the logs. Without these modules the notebook could leak GPU RAM across trials or miss the training-time evidence needed for the report.\n",
        "- The `from optuna.samplers import GridSampler, RandomSampler` line imports the exact samplers that map onto the lecture’s grid and random strategies, keeping the experiment faithful to the assignment while avoiding heavier third-party wrappers.\n",
        "- `AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED = True` acts as a master toggle; flipping it to `False` lets you skip the entire block during quick debugging runs without commenting out code. The following constants (`SEARCH_STRATEGIES`, `GRID_SEARCH_SPACE`, `RANDOM_SEARCH_SPACE`, `RANDOM_TRIALS`, `MAX_AUTOTUNE_EPOCHS`, `AUTO_TUNE_USE_CLASS_WEIGHTS`) scope the search so it respects the ~30‑minute window and mirrors the lecture exemplar.\n",
        "- `TUNING_DIR = Path(\"tuning\")` stores every trial artefact under a single folder, and `TUNING_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` makes the cell idempotent so reruns append new logs without manual setup.\n",
        "- The `if AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED:` guard wraps the `WeightedTrainer` definition. This subclass accepts optional class weights, forwards any extra keyword arguments such as `num_items_in_batch`, and is registered via `globals()['WeightedTrainer'] = WeightedTrainer` so helper functions can reference it safely.\n",
        "- `cls_counts_auto = df_train['label'].value_counts(...)` together with `class_weights_auto = ...` computes inverse-frequency weights reflecting the current (possibly down-sampled) training split. These arrays feed directly into the custom trainer so minority classes retain influence during loss computation.\n",
        "- `_clean_hp_dict` walks through hyperparameter dictionaries returned by Optuna and converts NumPy scalars to native Python types. That small cleanup prevents Excel exports from showing `np.float32` objects and keeps JSON/CSV serialization straightforward.\n",
        "- `build_trainer_for_trial(hparams, run_name)` encapsulates model creation, argument selection, and trainer construction for a single trial. It sets per-trial output directories, constrains evaluation/saving strategies to `no`, and returns both the trainer and its arguments so the caller can log metadata later.\n",
        "- `suggest_params(trial, strategy)` unifies the search logic: grid trials enumerate every combination, while random trials sample from explicit distributions, with epoch counts clamped to `MAX_AUTOTUNE_EPOCHS` to enforce the runtime budget.\n",
        "- `summary_rows = []` prepares an accumulator for the report table, while the nested `objective(trial)` function builds a trainer, times `trainer_obj.train()`, evaluates on the validation set, and stores metrics plus runtime in `trial.user_attrs`. Immediate cleanup (`del trainer_obj`, `gc.collect()`, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`) prevents GPU/CPU memory leaks during successive trials.\n",
        "- The outer loop over `SEARCH_STRATEGIES` creates an Optuna study with the appropriate sampler, runs `study.optimize(...)`, then materializes a per-strategy DataFrame of trial records—writing both CSV and, when `openpyxl` is available, Excel copies under `tuning/`.\n",
        "- After each study, `study.best_trial` is used to rebuild the winning configuration via `build_trainer_for_trial`, retrain it from scratch, evaluate on validation and test splits, export prediction CSVs, append a standardized row to `runs_log.csv`, and gather summary metrics for the comparison table.\n",
        "- Once all strategies finish, combined histories (`all_trials`, `strategy_summary`) are saved, optionally exported to Excel, and displayed in the notebook. Finally `AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED = False` ensures legacy sweep cells later in the notebook do not re-run now that the modern block has generated its artefacts.\n"

Sweep settings (`SWEEP`, `DEFAULT_BS`, `DEFAULT_EVAL_BS`) and environment flags (`USE_GPU_SWEEP`, `PIN_MEMORY_SWEEP`) determine how aggressively the loop explores learning rates, sequence lengths, and batch sizes.\n",

        "The helper `build_datasets_for_len` rebuilds tokenized datasets for each candidate max length, honoring Windows multiprocessing quirks. Each sweep iteration seeds all libraries for reproducibility, instantiates a fresh model, and configures `TrainingArguments` with evaluation/saving every 200 steps, early stopping on macro-F1, and GPU-friendly defaults like FP16 where available. During evaluation the loop tracks the highest validation macro-F1, persisting both the trainer and tokenizer for the winning run before exporting predictions and logging metrics.\n",

        "\n",
        "- `USE_GPU_SWEEP = torch.cuda.is_available()` and its companion worker/pin-memory settings adapt dataloader parameters to the current platform, preventing Windows multiprocessing crashes while maximizing throughput on CUDA.\n",
        "- `def build_datasets_for_len(max_len: int):` encapsulates rebuilding tokenized `Dataset` objects for each candidate sequence length, returning tensors formatted for PyTorch so the trainer can consume them without further preprocessing.\n",
        "- The `SWEEP` list enumerates lightweight configs (max length, seed, learning rate, epochs, batch size). Printing the list length and GPU state documents the experimental plan in the notebook output.\n",
        "- Inside the `for` loop, `set_seed(cfg['seed'])` guarantees reproducibility, `AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained` loads a fresh backbone for each trial, and the tailored `TrainingArguments` bundle ensures evaluation/save cadence, warmup ratio, class-weight compatibility, and FP16 usage line up with assignment requirements.\n",
        "- `callbacks = [EarlyStoppingCallback(...)]` wires early stopping to macro-F1 so trials halt once progress stalls, keeping runtimes tight. The subsequent `trainer_s.train()` / `trainer_s.evaluate()` pair captures both training duration and validation metrics for the log.\n",
        "- When a trial eclipses the current best macro-F1, the block saves the checkpoint/tokenizer into `checkpoints/{MODEL_CHOICE}/best`, ensuring later cells operate on the strongest weights without manual copying.\n",
        "- After the sweep, the `if best_run is not None:` block generates test-set predictions, writes them to CSV, and appends a structured record to `runs_log.csv`, completing the audit trail of hyperparameters and scores for the final report.\n"

        "# Reporting: test confusion matrices and comparison table\n",

        "**`Purpose`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Summarize test-set performance for baseline and transformer models through confusion matrices and a side-by-side scoreboard, furnishing the visuals and tables needed for the Results/Discussion sections of the IEEE report.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Input`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Consumes `baseline_predictions_test.csv` and `transformer_predictions_test.csv` generated earlier, plus the original `df_test` metadata when plotting. Relies on `sklearn.metrics` for confusion matrices and macro-F1 calculations, along with `matplotlib` for figure rendering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Output`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Writes PNG confusion matrices into `exports/`, produces `Sentiment_Comparison.(csv|xlsx)` ranked by macro-F1, and optionally displays the comparison DataFrame inline. If predictions are missing, the cell prints a reminder instead of failing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Details`**\n",
        "\n",
        "A shared `rows` list accumulates accuracy and macro-F1 for each available model. For every predictions file found, the cell computes metrics, renders and saves a confusion matrix, and appends a summary row. The final DataFrame is sorted descending by macro-F1 so the stronger approach is immediately apparent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Line-by-line Description`**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The import block grabs `confusion_matrix`, `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`, `accuracy_score`, and `f1_score`, ensuring consistent metrics with earlier evaluation cells.\n",
        "- `outdir = Path('exports'); outdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` guarantees figures and CSVs land in the export bundle alongside other artefacts.\n",
        "- Each `if os.path.exists(...):` guard reads prediction CSVs, derives metrics, plots the confusion matrix without a colorbar, and persists it to disk with descriptive filenames.\n",
        "- After iterating through models, `cmp = pd.DataFrame(rows).sort_values('f1_macro', ascending=False)` materializes the comparison table, writes CSV/Excel copies, and displays it for quick inspection.\n",
        "- The final `else: print('No predictions found yet...')` branch keeps the notebook narrative clear when prerequisite cells haven’t run, avoiding silent failures.\n"
