        "> This notebook documents the end-to-end FiReCS tri-class sentiment project, starting with deterministic data preparation and culminating in deployable artefacts. It begins by cleaning and splitting the Taglish review corpus, persisting split IDs so every experiment baseline or advanced evaluates on identical examples. Classic baselines (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) anchor performance expectations before the workflow escalates to transformer fine-tuning with multilingual and Filipino-focused backbones.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> The transformer track covers tokenization, hyperparameter sweeps, class weighting, and early stopping, ultimately selecting the best checkpoint via validation macro-F1. Detailed evaluation follows: confusion matrices, per-class reports, and exportable tables compare validation/test splits, while metric logs capture training dynamics. A dedicated accuracy-tuning section introduces label smoothing and longer schedules to cross the 80% accuracy bar on GPU-backed runs.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Beyond headline sentiment, the notebook prototypes roadmap extras. Aspect span bootstrapping heuristically derives BIO tags, enabling per-aspect polarity classifiers that learn from lexicon-triggered snippets. A deception detector featurizes stylometric cues to flag low-quality signals, and interactive widgets allow stakeholders to submit emoji-rich Taglish reviews for live predictions.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Final cells translate the strongest transformer into deployment formats, exporting ONNX graphs, quantized PyTorch weights, consolidated logs, and spreadsheet summaries. Together with saved checkpoints, tokenizer files, and experiment logs, these outputs guarantee that classmates and graders can reproduce, audit, and extend every stage of the workflow without rerunning training from scratch.\n",

        "This block prepares the environment, ensures required libraries are available, and loads the FiReCS dataset into memory in a clean, consistent format.

The goal is to make each downstream step predictable and to keep results comparable across runs and team members.\n",

Two proportion tables are printed as a quick check that label ratios are closely matched across splits.\n",

It then loads the CSV, normalizes column names to lowercase, removes empty rows, and casts labels to integers. A simple id index is added so that split membership can be saved and reused. A stratified split holds label balance constant, which is printed to confirm the split is fair. Finally, the selected IDs are saved to disk so that all later training and evaluation use the same records, which supports consistent comparison across hyperparameter sweeps and models.\n",

        "# Automated Hyperparameter Search (Grid vs Random)\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Purpose`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Run Optuna-driven grid and random searches on the reduced training slice, capture validation/test metrics for the best trial in each strategy, and generate artifacts needed for the Excel log and IEEE report. The search is scoped to stay within ~30 minutes on classroom hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Input`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses the tokenized datasets (`ds_train`, `ds_val`, `ds_test`), global tokenizer/model selections, and shared helpers (`compute_metrics`, `make_training_args`). Configuration depends on `AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED`, `GRID_SEARCH_SPACE`, `RANDOM_SEARCH_SPACE`, trial limits, and options such as `FAST_MODE`, `AUTO_TUNE_USE_CLASS_WEIGHTS`, and `MAX_AUTOTUNE_EPOCHS`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Output`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Writes per-strategy trial tables (`tuning/grid_trials.*`, `tuning/random_trials.*`), a combined `tuning/all_trials.*`, and a `tuning/strategy_summary.*` comparison sheet. Each winning configuration is retrained, evaluated on validation and test splits, logged to `runs_log.csv`, and its predictions exported for downstream analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Details`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Defines a lightweight `WeightedTrainer` compatible with Optuna’s newer training hooks, computes class weights from the current training labels, and registers helper functions to build Trainers for suggested hyperparameters. Optuna’s `GridSampler` and `RandomSampler` explore the respective spaces, timing each trial and storing validation metrics so the study can be resumed or audited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Line-by-line Description`**\n",
        "\n",
        "- `import gc` and `import time` bring in garbage-collection and timing utilities so each trial can free memory explicitly and record wall-clock duration for the logs. Without these modules the notebook could leak GPU RAM across trials or miss the training-time evidence needed for the report.\n",
        "- The `from optuna.samplers import GridSampler, RandomSampler` line imports the exact samplers that map onto the lecture’s grid and random strategies, keeping the experiment faithful to the assignment while avoiding heavier third-party wrappers.\n",
        "- `AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED = True` acts as a master toggle; flipping it to `False` lets you skip the entire block during quick debugging runs without commenting out code. The following constants (`SEARCH_STRATEGIES`, `GRID_SEARCH_SPACE`, `RANDOM_SEARCH_SPACE`, `RANDOM_TRIALS`, `MAX_AUTOTUNE_EPOCHS`, `AUTO_TUNE_USE_CLASS_WEIGHTS`) scope the search so it respects the ~30‑minute window and mirrors the lecture exemplar.\n",
        "- `TUNING_DIR = Path(\"tuning\")` stores every trial artefact under a single folder, and `TUNING_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` makes the cell idempotent so reruns append new logs without manual setup.\n",
        "- The `if AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED:` guard wraps the `WeightedTrainer` definition. This subclass accepts optional class weights, forwards any extra keyword arguments such as `num_items_in_batch`, and is registered via `globals()['WeightedTrainer'] = WeightedTrainer` so helper functions can reference it safely.\n",
        "- `cls_counts_auto = df_train['label'].value_counts(...)` together with `class_weights_auto = ...` computes inverse-frequency weights reflecting the current (possibly down-sampled) training split. These arrays feed directly into the custom trainer so minority classes retain influence during loss computation.\n",
        "- `_clean_hp_dict` walks through hyperparameter dictionaries returned by Optuna and converts NumPy scalars to native Python types. That small cleanup prevents Excel exports from showing `np.float32` objects and keeps JSON/CSV serialization straightforward.\n",
        "- `build_trainer_for_trial(hparams, run_name)` encapsulates model creation, argument selection, and trainer construction for a single trial. It sets per-trial output directories, constrains evaluation/saving strategies to `no`, and returns both the trainer and its arguments so the caller can log metadata later.\n",
        "- `suggest_params(trial, strategy)` unifies the search logic: grid trials enumerate every combination, while random trials sample from explicit distributions, with epoch counts clamped to `MAX_AUTOTUNE_EPOCHS` to enforce the runtime budget.\n",
        "- `summary_rows = []` prepares an accumulator for the report table, while the nested `objective(trial)` function builds a trainer, times `trainer_obj.train()`, evaluates on the validation set, and stores metrics plus runtime in `trial.user_attrs`. Immediate cleanup (`del trainer_obj`, `gc.collect()`, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`) prevents GPU/CPU memory leaks during successive trials.\n",
        "- The outer loop over `SEARCH_STRATEGIES` creates an Optuna study with the appropriate sampler, runs `study.optimize(...)`, then materializes a per-strategy DataFrame of trial records—writing both CSV and, when `openpyxl` is available, Excel copies under `tuning/`.\n",
        "- After each study, `study.best_trial` is used to rebuild the winning configuration via `build_trainer_for_trial`, retrain it from scratch, evaluate on validation and test splits, export prediction CSVs, append a standardized row to `runs_log.csv`, and gather summary metrics for the comparison table.\n",
        "- Once all strategies finish, combined histories (`all_trials`, `strategy_summary`) are saved, optionally exported to Excel, and displayed in the notebook. Finally `AUTO_TUNE_ENABLED = False` ensures legacy sweep cells later in the notebook do not re-run now that the modern block has generated its artefacts.\n"

        "### **Detailed Validation and Test Evaluation****`Purpose`**This cell consolidates precision, recall, F1, and accuracy metrics for both validation and test splits. It generates comprehensive classification reports, saves them to the `exports/` directory, and displays concise summary tables for quick comparison between splits. This provides a complete evaluation picture for the transformer model.**`Input`**The cell expects the trained `trainer` object from previous cells, along with the tokenized validation and test datasets (`ds_val` and `ds_test`). It also requires the label names for proper reporting.**`Output`**The cell produces classification reports for both validation and test splits, saved as CSV files in the `exports/` directory (`validation_classification_report.csv` and `test_classification_report.csv`). It also creates a summary metrics DataFrame comparing both splits and displays formatted tables in the notebook. The reports include per-class precision, recall, F1, support, and macro/micro averages.**`Details`**The cell iterates through both validation and test datasets, generates predictions using the trained model, and computes detailed classification reports using scikit-learn's `classification_report` function. Each report is converted to a DataFrame for easy viewing and exported to CSV. A summary DataFrame is created comparing key metrics (accuracy, macro-F1) across both splits, which is also saved to CSV. All outputs are displayed in the notebook using IPython's `display` function for immediate inspection.**`Line-by-line Description`**`from pathlib import Path` and `from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, f1_score` import necessary utilities.`export_dir = Path(\"exports\")` sets up the export directory.`label_names = ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']` defines the class labels.The loop `for split_name, dataset in ((\"validation\", ds_val), (\"test\", ds_test)):` iterates through both splits.`preds = trainer.predict(dataset)` generates predictions for the current split.`y_true = preds.label_ids` and `y_pred = np.argmax(preds.predictions, axis=1)` extract true and predicted labels.`report_dict = classification_report(...)` computes the detailed classification report.`report_df = pd.DataFrame(report_dict).transpose()` converts the report to a DataFrame.`display(Markdown(f\"#### {split_name.title()} classification report\"))` displays a formatted header.`display(report_df)` shows the report table in the notebook.`report_df.to_csv(export_dir / f\"{split_name}_classification_report.csv\")` saves the report to CSV.`summary_rows.append({...})` collects summary metrics for comparison.`metrics_df = pd.DataFrame(summary_rows)` creates a comparison DataFrame.`display(metrics_df)` shows the comparison table."

        "### **Visual Summary of Performance****`Purpose`**This cell creates a comprehensive visual summary of model performance by generating a grid of plots that compare validation and test set results. It displays confusion matrices for both splits side-by-side, bar charts comparing key metrics, and optionally training history plots. This visual comparison makes it easy to assess model performance and identify any overfitting or generalization issues.**`Input`**The cell expects the confusion matrices and classification reports generated in previous cells, stored in variables like `VAL_CONFUSION`, `TEST_CONFUSION`, `VAL_REPORT_DF`, and `TEST_REPORT_DF`. It also requires the `metrics_df` DataFrame with split comparisons.**`Output`**The cell produces a multi-panel figure (typically 2x2 or similar grid) displaying:- Validation confusion matrix- Test confusion matrix  - Bar chart comparing accuracy and macro-F1 across splits- Optional training history plots (if available)All figures are displayed inline in the notebook and may also be saved to the `exports/` directory.**`Details`**The cell uses matplotlib and seaborn to create a grid of subplots. Confusion matrices are displayed using `ConfusionMatrixDisplay` or custom plotting, showing the distribution of predictions across true labels. Bar charts compare key metrics (accuracy, macro-F1) between validation and test splits to quickly identify performance differences. If training history is available, line plots show loss and metric curves over training steps. The grid layout makes it easy to compare results at a glance.**`Line-by-line Description`**`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `import seaborn as sns` import plotting libraries.`fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))` creates a 2x2 grid of subplots.`ConfusionMatrixDisplay(VAL_CONFUSION, ...).plot(ax=axes[0, 0])` plots the validation confusion matrix.`ConfusionMatrixDisplay(TEST_CONFUSION, ...).plot(ax=axes[0, 1])` plots the test confusion matrix.`plot_df = metrics_df.melt(...)` reshapes the metrics DataFrame for plotting.`sns.barplot(data=plot_df, x='metric', y='score', hue='split', ax=axes[1, 0])` creates a bar chart comparing metrics.If training history exists, `axes[1, 1].plot(log_history['step'], log_history[col], label=col)` plots training curves.`plt.tight_layout()` adjusts spacing between subplots.`plt.show()` displays the figure in the notebook."

        "\n",
        "Package the best transformer checkpoint into deployment-friendly formats: a standards-compliant ONNX graph for cross-platform inference and a dynamically quantized PyTorch state dict for lightweight CPU serving. These artefacts satisfy the assignment’s reproducibility and deployment requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Input`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses `BEST_CKPT_DIR` (falling back to the default fine-tuned folder) along with the saved tokenizer to rebuild the model in evaluation mode. Relies on PyTorch’s ONNX exporter and dynamic quantization APIs, so the `torch` and `transformers` modules must already be imported.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Output`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Writes `model.onnx` and `pytorch_model_quantized.bin` into the same checkpoint directory, echoing the file paths to confirm success. The ONNX graph includes dynamic axes for batch and sequence length, keeping downstream consumers flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Details`**\n",
        "\n",
        "The cell generates a dummy tokenizer batch to trace the model with fixed maximum length—long enough for inference yet efficient for export. During ONNX export it names inputs/outputs explicitly and pins `opset_version=13` to match common runtime support. Dynamic quantization targets linear layers to shrink the CPU footprint without retraining.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`Line-by-line Description`**\n",
        "\n",
        "- `ckpt_dir = BEST_CKPT_DIR if ...` resolves the source directory, preferring the sweep-selected best model but gracefully falling back to the earlier fine-tuned path if the sweep has not run.\n",
        "- `tokenizer_exp = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(ckpt_dir, use_fast=True)` and the subsequent `model_exp = ... .cpu().eval()` reload the assets in inference mode on CPU to avoid GPU-only ops in the exported artefacts.\n",
        "- The `dummy = tokenizer_exp(...)` call builds representative input tensors, ensuring the export captures attention masks alongside input IDs.\n",
        "- `torch.onnx.export(...)` performs the graph trace, sets readable tensor names, and configures dynamic axes for batch/sequence so runtime clients can feed arbitrary batch sizes and lengths.\n",
        "- `quantized = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(...)` runs post-training dynamic quantization over linear layers, delivering a compact state dict saved via `torch.save` for fast CPU inference when ONNX isn’t available.\n"
